# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview:
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, aiming to understand the characteristics of passengers and factors influencing survival rates. The analysis is conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset Description:
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

## Files:
- **titanic_data.csv**: The dataset used for analysis.
- **titanic_eda.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for EDA..

## Analysis Steps:
1. **Data Loading and Inspection**: Loading the dataset and checking its structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Summary statistics of numerical features.
   - Distribution analysis of categorical features.
   - Visualization of relationships between variables.
   - Examination of factors affecting survival rates.

## Results:
- Insights gained from the analysis, such as survival rate trends, passenger demographics, and factors influencing survival.
- Visualizations including histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to illustrate findings.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open the `titanic_eda.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells to execute the code and visualize the analysis results.

## Libraries Used:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
